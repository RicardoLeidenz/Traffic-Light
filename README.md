# 📝 TODO List Application  

This is a simple TODO list application built with **React.js**. It allows users to add and delete tasks in a clean and minimal interface.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Adding Tasks**  
   - Type a task into the input field.  
   - Press **Enter** (or click the add button) to add it to the list.  

2. **Deleting Tasks**  
   - Hover over a task to reveal the **delete icon (🗑️)**.  
   - Click the icon to remove the task from the list.  

3. **Task Behavior**  
   - You can add as many tasks as you want.  
   - If there are **no tasks**, the app shows:  
     ```
     No tasks, add a task
     ```  
   - Tasks **cannot be edited** — to change one, delete it and add it again.
