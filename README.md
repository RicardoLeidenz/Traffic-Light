## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Traffic Light Display**  
   - The component shows **Red, Yellow, and Green** lights.  
   - Only one light glows at a time.  

2. **Click to Change**  
   - When a light is clicked, it becomes the active glowing light.  
   - The other lights turn off.  

3. **Cycle Button** → A button that cycles between **Red → Green → Yellow → Red**.  

4. **Add Purple Light** → A button that adds an extra **Purple** light to the traffic light.
